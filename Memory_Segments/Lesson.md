Certainly! Here's a summary of memory segments in a table format:

| Memory Segment | Description                                                                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code Segment (CS)     | Holds program instructions or code. Typically read-only to prevent accidental modification.        |
| Data Segment (DS)     | Contains global and static data variables used by the program.                                   |
| Stack Segment (SS)    | Used to store the program's stack, which holds temporary data, function call info, and variables. |
| Extra Segments (ES, FS, GS) | Additional segments that can be used for extra data or addressing capabilities.           |

Using memory segments helps organize and manage memory efficiently in assembly language programming. Each segment serves a specific purpose, such as storing program instructions, data variables, or managing the stack. Segment registers hold the segment addresses, which are combined with offset addresses to access specific memory locations. Although memory segmentation has become less prevalent in modern processor architectures, understanding memory segments is still important for legacy systems and certain programming models.
